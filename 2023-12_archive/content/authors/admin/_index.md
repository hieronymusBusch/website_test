I am a "pre-doc" at UC Berkeley & MIT. Previously, I studied Economics and Sociology at the LSE, Heidelberg University, and Goethe University Frankfurt. I grew up in Gelnhausen, a lovely town east of Frankfurt, Germany. 

My interests are in Microeconomics and Labour Economics - especially education and industrial relations. In current projects, I evaluate the economic impact of strikes, worker co-management, and education policies. 

Jointly with Chantal Pezold, I also run an online reading group on labour market institutions for PhD students and post-docs. While we keep this group at a limited size to allow for productive discussions, feel free to reach out if you are interested in joining. 

Outside academia, I had the privilege to work on evidence-based policy advocacy at the German Ministry of Finance, ver.di (united services trade union), and the German and Hessian Parliaments. I am teamlead of climate policy at Fiscal Future, a Berlin-based think tank for progressive fiscal policy.
