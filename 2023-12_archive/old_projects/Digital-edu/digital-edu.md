Project for the German Economic Association (Verein f√ºr Sozialpolitik): Website allowed university lecturers to exchange slides and teaching materials. Additionally, I run a blog for digital teaching tools. After the winter term 2020/2021, the website was defunct after having supplied many educaters with slides and tools.
