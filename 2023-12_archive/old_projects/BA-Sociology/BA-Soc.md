This study explores interactions of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany with social deprivation in the light of the current `syndemic'-debate. The relationships between incidence rates (IR) and case fatality ratios (CFR) with socioeconomic variables were assessed. SAR and OLS regression models on county scale (N=401) were fitted for monthly estimations from February 2020 to June 2021. The main findings are that IR are negatively associated with social deprivation in the beginning of the pandemic, but positively during the second and third wave. Counties with a higher share of foreign nationals, as well as counties located in the historic east, have higher IR during the second and third wave. No clear effect is found for CFR. It is concluded that IR are syndemic on the county scale, while CFR may not be. Furthermore, mistrust in the government (measured by votes for the far-right AfD party) was connected to higher IR during the second and third wave.
