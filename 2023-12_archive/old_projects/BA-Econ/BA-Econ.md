This paper examines the influence of political, structural, and fiscal variables on the endowment of a welfare program. The program financially supports welfare recipients who replace their inefficient fridge with a new one. In addition to federal financing, local partners that carry out the exchange were encouraged to attract additional funding. This results in a diverse landscape of regionally varying endowment. Logit and regular OLS regression models are used to explore the impact of several factors on the probability of the existence of additional funding and the amount. A leftist or female councilor, a higher share of women in the regional parliament, political contestability, vote turnout, and absence of welfare recipients increase the likelihood of additional local funding.
