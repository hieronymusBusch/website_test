abstract: What is the impact of "compressing" education -- teaching the same content in fewer years -- on wages? I use administrative wage data and the staggered introduction of a German school reform to answer this question. I find a considerable causal wage premium of due to this head start, which can be mostly explained by the additional work experience graduates gain from finishing earlier. I find no impact on indicators for job match quality, or different sorting into firms, occupations, or industries. I thus conclude that returns to education have apparently not been affected by the policy.
